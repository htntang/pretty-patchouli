We are building an e-commerce store and this will be actually two projects because when we are going to build an e-commerce store, we need products, so an admin panel is necessary.

So two folders will be created:
[ecommerce-frontend]: The interface wherein the users will interact with the with the site.
[ecommerce-admin]: Where CRUD operations can take place.

We are going to start with the [ecommerce-admin] project. Because we need products to put onto the ecommerce frontend.

Both projects will be built with Next.JS

For [ecommerce-admin], I will use Tailwind CSS; but in [ecommerce-frontend], I will use components so that I can re-use them.

https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-next-app
I start my project with the following command:
*npx create-next-app@latest

Select "no src" when the options arise. 
Select "yes" to eslint.

I run *npm run dev to launch my app.

Command Line:
*npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/tailwind-css

Go into the tailwind.config.js file and replace as needed.
Go into the globals.css file and replace as needed.

Replace the layout section with the text. Test it out.
